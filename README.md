# The Qt Simple File Hashing Application

This application was designed to be a basic GUI file hashing application. It supports most of the functions it should, including a lot of different file formats, opening multiple files or directories, drag-and-drop, and copying hashes. It has been translated to multiple languages already. There's a lot more that needs to be done.

Such as:

- Getting the matching window to work. This is priority 1!
- Getting Context Menu installation to work so users can hash files with only a right-click!
- Pausing and unpausing.

There is also a slough of bugs most likely.
